# Breakout
This game was built in Javascript and canvas. This is my first attempt at combining canvas within React

## Step-by-step
- [x] Create a canvas for my game
- [x] Create a start button which starts the game    
- [x] Draw a paddle on the canvas
- [x] Moving the paddle left and right
- [x] Draw a ball on the screen
- [x] Make the ball move 
- [x] Make sure the ball bounces off the paddle
- [x] If the ball goes off the screen - game over

## Instructions

```js
$ node -v
